## Professional Statement

Hello, I'm Kevin Guertin, a software developer primarily working on mobile development using React Native and Swift. I am adept at learning new technologies, finding solutions and communicating technological needs or requirements. I am interested in cybersecurity because I feel it aligns with my core values of building safe and reelable software that protects an organization's data and reputation and user's personal information and data. I am hoping to combine my existing strengths with new experience with cybersecurity to build software that implements strong application security principles.
